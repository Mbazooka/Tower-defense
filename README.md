# Tower Defense

## Introduction
As part of the Bachelor of Computer Science students have to make their first large scale application. During that academic year 
students had to make a tower defense game in Scheme. Scheme was used to avoid usage of libraries, so that 
we get solid programming foundations, applicable in many other programming languages. The idea of the game 
is that user get a path on which monster appear that try to reach the end of the path. Users can defend that path
by buying towers and power ups. Every round the user gets money for "winning" the round. When a level, which consits 
of multiple rounds, finishes the user gets more money, a new path, and the difficulty increases.

as follows:
