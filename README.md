# Tower-defense
As a first computer science student I had to make a tower defense game. The purpose of the game is to have a path on which monsters run, and the user can put differen types of towers around the path which shoot the different types of monsters. There are different waves and level to the game, each level having its own path. In addition to that shooting the monster earns the user money, with which he can buy towers and power-ups. 

An illustration of the game is shown below.
